                    to stay home instead of coming out in the streets and providing some relief during this crisis

                <p>in this pandemic situation for those with no place to go or in need of emergency shelter, local
                    Salvation Army homeless shelters provide a warm, safe place for men, women, and whenever possible
                    families to stay. In cities where we do not operate homeless shelters, we offer financial
                    assistance to cover emergency overnight housing costs or refer those facing housing and food
                    insecurity to partner programs with emergency shelter services.</p>

                <p>AdoptAClassroom.org's platform has always provided teachers and schools with the flexibility to order
                    exactly what they need for their students, and a full year to spend each donation. Donors who
                    contribute directly to an individual teacher or school get a list of exactly what was purchased.
                    Donors to our Spotlight Funds get sample stories from teachers who received grants</p>
